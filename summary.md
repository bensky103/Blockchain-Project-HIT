# Election Contract Implementation Summary

## Core Voting Functionality Implemented

### Key Features Added

1. **OpenZeppelin MerkleProof Integration**
   - Added `@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol` import
   - Implemented `onlyWhitelisted(proof, voter)` modifier with proper Merkle tree verification
   - Uses `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(voter))` as leaf nodes

2. **Voting State Management**
   - `mapping(address=>bool) hasVoted` - tracks voters to prevent double voting
   - Existing mappings: `voterToCandidate`, `candidates`, `totalVotes`

3. **Direct Voting Function**
   - `voteDirect(uint256 candidateId, bytes32[] calldata proof)`
   - Requirements: election open, not voted, valid candidate ID, active candidate, valid Merkle proof
   - Actions: increment vote count, set hasVoted=true, mint BAL reward, emit Voted event
   - Protected with reentrancy guard (`nonReentrant`)

4. **Quiz-Based Anonymous Voting**
   - `voteByQuiz(uint8[3] calldata answers, bytes32[] calldata proof)`
   - Computes L1 distance against each candidate's questionnaire profile
   - Automatically selects best matching candidate (minimum distance)
   - Returns only success boolean, candidate ID not revealed to caller
   - Emits Voted event with chosen candidate ID for transparency

5. **Election Finalization**
   - `finalizeIfEnded()` - callable by anyone after endTs
   - No state changes, only emits `ResultsFinalized` event

6. **Results and Ranking**
   - `getRanking()` - returns unsorted candidate IDs and vote counts (gas-efficient)
   - `getWinningCandidate()` - on-chain function to find candidate with max votes
   - Existing `getRankedResults()` provides sorted results with bubble sort

7. **Security Measures**
   - Reentrancy protection: `nonReentrant` modifier on both voting functions
   - State updates before external calls (CEI pattern)
   - Proper access control with `onlyWhitelisted` modifier

8. **Token Reward Integration**
   - `setupTokenMinter()` function allows Election contract to become authorized minter
   - Both voting functions mint voteReward BAL tokens to voters
   - Uses existing BalToken.mintVoteReward() function

## Voting APIs

### Direct Voting
```solidity
function voteDirect(uint256 candidateId, bytes32[] calldata proof) external
```

### Anonymous Quiz Voting
```solidity
function voteByQuiz(uint8[3] calldata answers, bytes32[] calldata proof) external returns (bool)
```

## Gas Optimization Notes

- `getRanking()` returns unsorted results to save gas (UI should handle sorting)
- `getWinningCandidate()` provides simple on-chain winner detection
- L1 distance calculation uses efficient absolute difference computation

## Security Assumptions

- Merkle tree leaves are `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(voter))`
- Questionnaire profiles use uint8[3] with values 0-10
- Single vote per address enforcement via `hasVoted` mapping
- Election timing controlled by `startTs` and `endTs` variables
