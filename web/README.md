## üêõ Common Errors & Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
**"Wrong Network"**

**"Wallet Not Connected"**
- **Cause**: No Web3 wallet connected
- **Solution**: Connect MetaMask or compatible wallet

### Permission Errors
**"Not Contract Owner"**
- **Cause**: Trying to access admin functions without owner privileges

  - Verify contract parameters
  - Try again with higher gas price
  - Check Debug Panel for transaction details

**"Pending Transaction"**
