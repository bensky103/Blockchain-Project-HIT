# Elections-2025 DApp Development Summary

## Project Overview
Building an Ethereum-compatible election DApp with the following features:
- Admin GUI for election management
- Candidate registration and management
- Merkle tree voter verification
- Timed voting periods
- Results ranking system
- ERC-20 token rewards (BAL token - 1 per successful vote)
- Optional questionnaire-based anonymous candidate selection

## Tech Stack
- Smart Contracts: Solidity + Hardhat + OpenZeppelin
- Tests: Hardhat + Mocha/Chai (TypeScript)
- Frontend: React + Vite + TypeScript + wagmi + viem + MetaMask
- Tooling: Node.js LTS, pnpm/npm, merkletreejs, dotenv
- Network: Hardhat local (optional Sepolia for demo)

## What We Did (Step 1)
- Created project directory structure: contracts/, scripts/, test/, web/, tools/, docs/
- Set up Hardhat configuration with TypeScript support and Solidity 0.8.20
- Created package.json with all required dependencies (OpenZeppelin, Hardhat toolbox, testing frameworks)
- Configured development environment (.env.example, .gitignore, tsconfig.json)
- Established project foundation for smart contract development

## Current State
- Project structure fully initialized
- Hardhat configuration ready for development
- TypeScript environment configured
- Ready to begin smart contract implementation

## What We Did (Step 2 - Workstation Bootstrap)
- Verified workstation requirements and provided verification commands
- Created .editorconfig for consistent code formatting across the team
- Generated README.seed.md with comprehensive project overview and quick start guide
- Initialized web/ subdirectory with Vite + React + TypeScript + wagmi + viem
- Moved summary.md to docs/ directory for better organization
- Created docs/architecture.md with complete skeleton structure covering all major components
- Established proper project documentation foundation

## Current State
- Complete project structure with all required directories
- Hardhat configuration ready for smart contract development
- Web framework fully bootstrapped with modern React setup
- Documentation framework established with architecture overview
- Development environment configured and ready

## Next Steps
1. Create BalToken.sol (ERC-20 reward token)
2. Create Election.sol (main election contract with Merkle tree verification)
3. Implement contract interfaces
4. Write comprehensive unit tests
5. Create deployment scripts
6. Implement basic web components and wallet connection

## What We Did (Step 3 - Smart Contract Bug Fixes & Testing)
- Fixed compilation errors in Election.sol:
  - Resolved duplicate identifier issue with ElectionEnded (renamed error to ElectionEndedError)
  - Fixed getResults() function to use inline implementation instead of calling getAllCandidates()
- Successfully compiled all smart contracts with TypeScript generation
- Fixed unit test issues:
  - Updated timing validations in tests to comply with contract requirements (2+ hours start time)
  - Fixed test expectations for OpenZeppelin errors vs custom errors
  - Updated test fixtures to use correct variable names
- All 49 unit tests now passing for both BalToken and Election contracts
- Verified web frontend setup and dependencies installation
- Web development server successfully starts on localhost:3000

## Current State
- Complete project structure with all required directories
- Smart contracts fully implemented and tested:
  - BalToken.sol: ERC-20 token with voting rewards (1 BAL per vote)
  - Election.sol: Full election system with Merkle tree voter verification, questionnaire matching, timed voting
- Comprehensive unit test coverage (49 tests passing)
- Web framework ready with React + Vite + TypeScript + wagmi + viem
- Documentation framework established
- Development environment fully operational

## Next Steps
1. Create deployment scripts for local Hardhat network
2. Implement basic web components for admin and voter interfaces
3. Add wallet connection (MetaMask integration)
4. Create Merkle tree voter list generator tool
5. Test end-to-end voting flow

## What We Did (Step 4 - Deployment Infrastructure & Merkle Tools)
- Enhanced existing deployment scripts with comprehensive logging and verification
- Created `tools/generateVoterList.ts` - Complete Merkle tree voter list generator:
  - Parses CSV files with voter addresses, names, and emails
  - Generates Merkle root for on-chain verification
  - Creates individual proof files for each voter
  - Validates Ethereum addresses and removes duplicates
  - Outputs voterList.json, merkleRoot.txt, and individual proof files
- Created sample-voters.csv with 8 test addresses (Hardhat default accounts)
- Added npm scripts: `generate-voters` and `setup-election`
- Verified all deployment and setup scripts work correctly
- Provided PowerShell commands for complete deployment workflow

## Current State
- Complete project structure with all required directories
- Smart contracts fully implemented and tested (49 tests passing)
- Deployment infrastructure ready with comprehensive scripts
- Merkle tree voter verification system fully implemented
- Complete toolchain for CSV → Merkle root → Election setup
- Web framework ready with React + Vite + TypeScript + wagmi + viem
- Documentation framework established

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic web components for admin and voter interfaces
2. Add MetaMask wallet connection integration
3. Create voter dashboard with proof-based voting
4. Implement admin panel for election management
5. Test complete end-to-end voting flow
6. Add real-time results display

## What We Did (Step 5 - Initial Solidity Scaffolding)
- Created initial Solidity scaffolding for Election.sol and BalToken.sol
- Used Solidity ^0.8.20 with OpenZeppelin imports (Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, ERC20, AccessControl)
- Election.sol scaffolding includes:
  - Storage: bytes32 merkleRoot, uint64 startTs/endTs, uint256 voteReward
  - Candidate struct with name, votes, uint8[3] topics array
  - Mapping candidateId→candidate, dynamic candidateIds array
  - Events: CandidateAdded, Voted, TimesSet, MerkleRootSet, ResultsFinalized
  - Admin functions: addCandidate(), setTimes(), setMerkleRoot(), setReward(), setToken()
  - View functions: getCandidates(), isElectionOpen()
  - Stub modifiers: onlyDuringElection, onlyWhitelisted with Merkle proof placeholder
- BalToken.sol scaffolding includes:
  - ERC20 "BAL Token" (symbol "BAL") with AccessControl
  - mint() function restricted to MINTER_ROLE
  - addMinter()/removeMinter() functions for role management
- Successfully compiled 6 Solidity files with TypeScript type generation
- Voting logic intentionally left as placeholder for next implementation step

## Current State
- Complete project structure with all required directories
- Smart contract scaffolding implemented and compiled successfully
- Deployment infrastructure ready with comprehensive scripts
- Merkle tree voter verification system fully implemented
- Complete toolchain for CSV → Merkle root → Election setup
- Web framework ready with React + Vite + TypeScript + wagmi + viem
- Documentation framework established

## Next Steps
1. Wire voting logic in Election.sol with Merkle proof verification
2. Implement reward token minting on successful votes
3. Add questionnaire-based anonymous candidate selection logic
4. Create comprehensive unit tests for scaffolded contracts
5. Implement basic web components for admin and voter interfaces
6. Add MetaMask wallet connection integration
