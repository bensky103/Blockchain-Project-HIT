# Elections-2025 DApp Architecture

## Overview

The Elections-2025 DApp is a decentralized election platform built on Ethereum, featuring secure voter verification through Merkle trees, transparent voting processes, and token-based incentives.

### Key Components
- Smart contract layer (Solidity)
- Frontend application (React + TypeScript)
- Voter verification system (Merkle trees)
- Token reward mechanism (ERC-20)

## Contracts

### Election.sol
Main election contract responsible for:
- Election lifecycle management (setup, voting, results)
- Candidate registration and management
- Merkle tree-based voter verification
- Vote counting and result calculation
- Integration with reward token system

### BalToken.sol
ERC-20 token contract for voter rewards:
- Token minting for successful votes
- Access control for election contract
- Standard ERC-20 functionality

### Interfaces
- IElection.sol: Election contract interface
- IBalToken.sol: Token contract interface

## Data Flows

### Voter Registration Flow
1. Admin generates voter eligibility list
2. Merkle tree created from voter addresses
3. Merkle root stored on-chain
4. Individual proof generation for each voter

### Voting Flow
1. Voter connects MetaMask wallet
2. Voter submits Merkle proof for eligibility verification
3. Vote cast and recorded on-chain
4. BAL tokens minted as reward
5. Vote tallying updated in real-time

### Admin Flow
1. Admin deploys contracts
2. Election configuration (candidates, timing, parameters)
3. Voter list management and Merkle tree generation
4. Election lifecycle control (start, end, results)

## Frontend

### Architecture
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite build system
- wagmi + viem for Ethereum integration
- React Router for navigation

### Key Pages
- Landing/Connect page
- Voter dashboard
- Admin panel
- Results display
- Candidate profiles

### State Management
- React Context for app state
- wagmi hooks for blockchain state
- Local storage for user preferences

## Deployments

### Local Development
- Hardhat local network
- Automated deployment scripts
- Test data generation

### Testnet (Sepolia)
- Public testnet deployment
- Faucet integration
- Demo voter lists

### Security Considerations
- Input validation and sanitization
- Reentrancy protection
- Access control patterns
- Gas optimization
- Front-running protection

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
- Single election per contract instance
- Fixed voting duration
- Limited candidate metadata

### Future Enhancements
- Multi-election support
- Dynamic voting periods
- Enhanced candidate profiles
- Mobile-responsive design improvements
- Gas optimization strategies
